The goal of XAMPP is to build an easy to install distribution for developers to get into the world of Apache. To make it convenient for developers, XAMPP is configured with all features turned on. In the case of commercial use please take a look at the product licenses, from the XAMPP point of view commercial use is also free. There are currently distributions for Windows, Linux, and OS X."

msgstr ""

msgid "XAMPP is not meant for production use but only for development environments. The way XAMPP is configured is to be open as possible to allow the developer anything he/she wants. For development environments this is great but in a production environment it could be fatal."

msgstr ""

msgid "The MySQL administrator (root) has no password."
msgstr ""

msgid "The MySQL daemon is accessible via network."
msgstr ""

msgid "ProFTPD uses the password \"lampp\" for user \"daemon\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "PhpMyAdmin is accessible via network."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples are accessible via network."
msgstr ""

msgid "To fix most of the security weaknesses simply call the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "It starts a small security check and makes your XAMPP installation secure. For example this protects the XAMPP demo pages by a username ('lampp') and password combination."

msgid "What is the meaning of the error messages I see when starting XAMPP?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You may get several error messages while starting XAMPP:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The LAMPP startup script did not start XAMPP-Apache because there is an Apache instance already running. To start XAMPP properly, first you have to stop this daemon."

msgid "This is mostly due to the same reasons as the above error. The LAMPP startup script found a MySQL daemon already running on your system. To start LAMPP properly, you have to stop this daemon first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Apache doesn't seems to start. What can I do? "
msgstr ""

msgid "This error can exist for multiple reasons. Apache displays this error under several circumstances. To find the exact reason we have to do some research:"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do I do if the error message is \"Cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Some Linux distributions have SELinux activated by default and this is preventing the successful start of XAMPP. You should deactivate it in order to start the XAMPP servers:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now XAMPP should work fine again."
msgstr ""

msgid "After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running! How can I fix this?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "There is no real standard way to configure the boot process of a Linux system, but most of them should allow you to start XAMPP at boot time using the following steps."
msgstr ""

msgid "If your Linux distro uses \"update-rc.d\" tool to install the services:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If your Linux distro uses \"chkconfig\" tool to install the services you can run the following commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I make my XAMPP installation more secure?"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the default installation, XAMPP has no passwords set and it is not recommended to run XAMPP with this configuration accessible by others."

msgstr ""

msgid "Double-click on the image to start the installation process."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's all. XAMPP is now installed below the /Applications/XAMPP directory."

msgid "XAMPP for Windows exists in three different flavors:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installer:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Probably the easiest way to install XAMPP."
msgstr ""

msgid "For purists: XAMPP as ordinary ZIP archive."
msgstr ""

msgid "For purists with low bandwidth: XAMPP as 7zip archive."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note: If you extract the files, there can be false-positives virus warnings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the installer:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the installer from the Downloads page is the easiest way to install XAMPP. After the installation is complete, you will find XAMPP under Start | Programs | XAMPP. You can use the XAMPP Control Panel to start/stop all server and also install/uninstall services."
msgstr ""

msgid "The XAMPP control panel for start/stop Apache, MySQL, FileZilla & Mercury or install these server as services."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unzip the zip archives into the folder of your choice. XAMPP is extracting to the subdirectory \"C:\\xampp\" below the selected target directory. Now start the file \"setup_xampp.bat\", to adjust the XAMPP configuration to your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you choose a root directory \"C:\\\" as target, you must not start \"setup_xampp.bat\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like with the installer version, you can now use the \"XAMPP Control Panel\" for additional tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I start XAMPP without setup?"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you extract XAMPP in a top level folder like \"C:\\" or \"D:\\", you can start most servers like Apache or MySQL directly without execution of the file \"setup_xampp.bat\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not using the setup script, or selecting relative paths in the setup script, is preferred if you are installing XAMPP on a usb drive. Because on each pc such a drive can have an other drive letter. You can switch from absolute to relative paths at any time with the setup script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the installer from our Downloads page is the easiest way to install XAMPP. After the installation is complete, you will find XAMPP under   Start | Programs | XAMPP. You can use the XAMPP Control Panel to start/stop all server and also install/uninstall services."

msgid "The default users of Mercury and FileZilla are known."
msgstr ""

msgid "All points can be a huge security risk. Especially if XAMPP is accessible via network and people outside your LAN. It can also help to use a firewall or a (NAT) router. In case of a router or firewall, your PC is normally not accessible via network. It is up to you to fix these problems. As a small help there is the \"XAMPP Security console\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please secure XAMPP before publishing anything online. A firewall or an external router are only sufficient for low levels of security. For slightly more security, you can run the \"XAMPP Security console\" and assign passwords."

msgid "If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, you should go to the following URI which can fix some problems:"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the security console you can set a password for the MySQL user \"root\" and phpMyAdmin. You can also enable a authentication for the XAMPP demopages."
msgstr ""

msgid "This web based tool does not fix any additional security issues! Especially the FileZilla FTP server and the Mercury mail server you must secure yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I uninstall XAMPP?"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you installed XAMPP using the installer version, please use the Uninstaller. The Uninstaller will delete all XAMPP entries from your registry and it will uninstall some installed services included with XAMPP. We highly recommend that you use the Uninstall program for removing XAMPP installations from the Installer version.Please backup all the data you want to keep before uninstalling XAMPP."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you installed XAMPP using the ZIP and 7zip versions, shut down all XAMPP servers and exit all panels. If you installed any services, uninstall and shut them down too.

msgid "What is the \"lite\" version of XAMPP?"

msgid "What are \"Automatic start pages\" for the WWW directories?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The standard filename for the Apache function \"DirectoryIndex\" is \"index.html\" or \"index.php\". Every time you are just browsing to a folder (e.g. \"http://localhost/xampp/\"), and Apache can find such a file, Apache is displaying this file instead of a directory listing."

msgid "Why have changes in my php.ini not taken effect?"

msgid "If a change in the \"php.ini\" has no effect, it's possible PHP is using a different one. You can verify this with phpinfo(). Go to the URI  http://localhost/xampp/phpinfo.php and search for \"Loaded Configuration File\". This value shows you the \"php.ini\" PHP is really using."

msgstr ""

msgid "We have included all dependences and servers required for running the bundled web application, so you will find that XAMPP installs large numbers of files. If you are installing a XAMPP application on a Windows machine with an antivirus app enabled, this may slow down the installation significantly, and there is also a chance that one of the servers (web server, database server) may be blocked by the antivirus software. If you have an antivirus tool enabled, check the following settings for running XAMPP without performance issues:"
