= Enable Remote Access to phpMyAdmin

include::{docdir}/_includes/common/access-phpmyadmin-remotely/introduction.adoc[]

To enable remote access to phpMyAdmin from other hosts, follow these steps:

 . Edit the _etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf_ file in your XAMPP installation directory (usually, _/opt/lampp_).
 
 . Within this file, find the block below:
+ 
  <Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
    Require local
    ...
+  
Update this block and replace _Require local_ with _Require all granted_, so that it looks like this:
+
  <Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
    Require all granted
    ...
  
 . Save the file and restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.

You should now be able to access phpMyAdmin from other hosts.
