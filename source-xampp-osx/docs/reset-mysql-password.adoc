= Reset the MySQL/MariaDB Root Password

By default, the MySQL/MariaDB installation that ships with XAMPP has an empty root password. This is a serious security risk, especially if you plan to use XAMPP in production scenarios.

To change the MySQL/MariaDB root password, follow these steps:

 . Ensure that the MySQL/MariaDB server is running.

 . Open a new terminal.

 . Use the _mysqladmin_ command-line utility to alter the MySQL/MariaDB password, using the following syntax:
+
 mysqladmin --user=root password "newpassword"
+
The _mysqladmin_ command-line utility is located within the _bin/_ subdirectory of the XAMPP installation directory, typically _/Applications/XAMPP_.
+
For example, to change the MySQL/MariaDB root password from its default empty value to the password _gue55me_, you would execute:
+
 /Applications/XAMPP/bin/mysqladmin --user=root password "gue55me"
+

+
Or, if a password has already been previously set and you'd like to change it to a new one, you can use the following syntax:
+
 mysqladmin --user=root --password=oldpassword password "newpassword"
+
For example, to change the root password from _12345_ to _gue55me_, you would execute:
+
 /Applications/XAMPP/bin/mysqladmin --user=root --password=12345 password "gue55me"

 . Test that your password change has been accepted, by attempting to connect to the MySQL/MariaDB server using the _mysql_ command-line client in the same directory. For example, you could use the command below to connect to the server and return the results of a calculation:
+
 /Applications/XAMPP/bin/mysql --user=root --password=gue55me -e "SELECT 1+1"
