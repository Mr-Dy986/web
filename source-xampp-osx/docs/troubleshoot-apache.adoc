== Another Web Server Daemon is Already Running

XAMPP displays a message like:

 Another web server daemon is already running.

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

 . Open a new terminal window.

 . Use the lsof command to identify which other service is currently using port 80 and/or 443.

 sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP | grep LISTEN
+
image::troubleshoot-apache/image1.png[]

 . Terminate services currently using those ports.

You should now be able to start Apache successfully.

TIP: If the problem persists even after performing these steps, refer to http://askubuntu.com/questions/105952/cannot-start-xampp[this source thread] and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1192606[this forum post] for alternative solutions.
