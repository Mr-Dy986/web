= Enable Remote Access to phpMyAdmin

include::{docdir}/_includes/common/access-phpmyadmin-remotely/introduction.adoc[]

To enable remote access to phpMyAdmin from other hosts, follow these steps:

 . Launch the stack manager by double-clicking the XAMPP icon in the mounted disk image.
 
 . Ensure that Apache and MySQL services are running in the "Services" tab of the stack manager (or start them as needed).
 
 . Open a new terminal from the "General" tab of the stack manager.
 
 . Edit the _/opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf_ file.
 
 . Within this file, find the block below:
+ 
  <Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
    Require local
    ...
+  
Update this block and replace _Require local_ with _Require all granted_, so that it looks like this:
+
  <Directory "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin">
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
    Require all granted
    ...
  
 . Save the file and restart the Apache service using the stack manager.

You should now be able to access phpMyAdmin from other hosts.
