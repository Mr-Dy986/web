Although you might not have realized this, XAMPP comes with a number of https://www.apachefriends.org/add-ons.html[add-on applications]. These add-ons include https://www.drupal.org/[Drupal], http://www.joomla.org/[Joomla!], https://wordpress.com/[WordPress] and many other popular open source applications. The add-ons can be easily installed on top of XAMPP using a simple installation tool and are pre-configured to work out of the box, freeing you from the time and effort of downloading and configuring the applications separately.

XAMPP add-ons are provided by https://bitnami.com/[Bitnami], which specializes in pre-configured infrastructure and application stacks for native, virtual machine and cloud use. Bitnami stacks work the same way across platforms - this means that by using the WordPress Bitnami add-on instead of "rolling your own" WordPress configuration, you're guaranteed that your WordPress blog will look and work the same way even if you later migrate it from your local XAMPP environment to a cloud server.
