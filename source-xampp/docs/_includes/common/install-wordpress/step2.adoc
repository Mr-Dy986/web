By default, WordPress is installed in your XAMPP installation directory, in the _apps/wordpress_ subdirectory. The installation process will, by default, launch your browser and take you to the new WordPress blog anyway, but you can also access it directly at http://127.0.0.1/wordpress or http://localhost/wordpress. The screenshot below shows what you will typically see.

To delete this sample post or to create a new post, you need to first log in to the WordPress dashboard. You can do this either by clicking the "Log in" link in the left navigation bar or by browsing to http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php.

Log in using the administrator account you created in the previous step.

You should now arrive at the WordPress dashboard, which allows you to manage posts, pages and comments; customize your blog with themes and plugins; import and export content; manage navigation menus; add or delete new user accounts; and much more.
