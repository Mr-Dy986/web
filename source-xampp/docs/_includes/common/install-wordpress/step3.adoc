As a general rule, you shouldn't use the administrator account for routine tasks, such as creating posts or replying to comments. So, one of the first things you should do is create a new user account with minimal privileges, which you can use for these routine tasks. To do this:

 * Select the "Users -> Add New" menu option to create a new user account.

 * Enter a username, real name, password and other details for the account.
 * Assign the new account the role of "Editor".
 * Click the "Add New User" button to create the new user account.

Once the account is created, use the "Log out" button (in the pop-up menu at the top left corner of the page) to log out. Then, log in using the new account you just created. You should return to the WordPress dashboard, but with a restricted set of tools.

You can now add a new post using the following steps:

 * Select the "Posts -> Add New" menu option to create a new post.

 * Enter a title and content for the post. You can use the formatting tools at the top of the content area to format your post and add hyperlinks or images.
 * Optionally, choose the format and category for your post.
 * Publish it immediately using the "Publish" button.

And now, when you visit your blog's front page, you should see your new post.

Congratulations! You now have a working, fully-functional WordPress blog.

You can keep your WordPress installation up-to-date with the WordPress automatic update feature. To access this:

 * Log in to WordPress using the administrator account.
 * Select the "Dashboard -> Updates" menu item.

 * Review the resulting page to see if WordPress needs an update. If an update it available, you can install it by clicking the "Update Now" button. You can also re-install WordPress if needed with the "Re-install Now" button.
