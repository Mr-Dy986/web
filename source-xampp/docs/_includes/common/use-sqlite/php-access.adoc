The previous steps discussed how to create and use an SQLite database using the command-line client. However, more often than not, you'll be using an SQLite database in combination with a PHP-powered Web application. XAMPP includes the PHP SQLite extension, so doing this is not very difficult at all.

To connect to your SQLite database and execute queries on it with PHP, use your text editor to create an example script named _sqlite.php_ in the _htdocs_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory and fill it with the following code:

 <?php
 $db = new SQLite3('mydb.sq3');
 $sql = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE price < 3.00";
 $result = $db->query($sql);  
 while ($row = $result->fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC)){
   echo $row['name'] . ': $' . $row['price'] . '<br/>';
 }
 unset($db);

The first line of code creates a new SQLite3 object, using the _mydb.sq3_ database file you created earlier. Then, the object's _query()_ method is used to execute a SELECT query on the database, and the result object's _fetchArray()_ method is used to iterate over the result set. Adding the SQLITE3_ASSOC parameter to the _fetchArray()_ method tells PHP to return the results as an associative array, making it easy to access individual fields of the result set and display them on a Web page.

Once done, save your changes and ensure that your Apache server is running. Then, browse to http://localhost/sqlite.php to execute the script. You should see something like this:
