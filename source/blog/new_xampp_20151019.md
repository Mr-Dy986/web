Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for Windows, OS X and Linux with <b>MariaDB 10.0.17</b> and the latest <b>PHP</b> versions: <b>5.5.30</b> & <b>5.6.14</b>.

MariaDB is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL and is available under the terms of the GPL v2 license. It's developed by the MariaDB community with the MariaDB Foundation as its main steward. MariaDB is kept up to date with the latest MySQL release from the same branch and in most respects MariaDB will work exactly as MySQL. All commands, interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

You can download new versions at <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html</a>.

- Updated PHP to 5.5.30 / 5.6.14
- Updated Apache to 2.4.17
- Updated MariaDB to 10.0.17

We need your help to continue improving our new Dashboard! Please post any suggestions in our <a href="https://community.apachefriends.org/f/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=69810">forum thread</a>.
