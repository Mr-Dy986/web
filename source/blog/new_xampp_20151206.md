Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for Windows, OS X and Linux. This is a security release to update <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt">OpenSSL 1.0.1q</a> for OS X and Linux versions. The PHP version has not been upgraded for Windows yet. We use the official PHP compiled binaries for Windows and we will update it as soon as they are released.

You can download new versions at <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html</a>.

<b>v5.5.30-6 / v5.6.15-1</b>

- Updated PHP to 5.6.15
- Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.1q for OS X and Linux
- Fixed issues with phpMyAdmin for OS X and Linux

Do you want to try PHP 7? We are working on upgrading XAMPP to PHP 7.0.0 version. In the mean time, try Bitnami <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp/installer">WAMP for Windows</a>, <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp/installer">Bitnami MAMP for OS X</a> or <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer">Bitnami LAMP for Linux</a>.

Enjoy!
