Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for all platforms with PHP 7.1.x. This version of PHP comes with numerous improvements and new features such as Nullable types, Void return type and many more features and changesâ€¦

We also released new versions of XAMPP for all platforms with the latest PHP versions: 5.6.30 and 7.0.15.

You can download new versions <b>5.6.30 / 7.0.15 / 7.1.1</b> at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

<b>v7.0.15-0</b>

According to the PHP official site, the 5.5 branch was closed the 21st of July when the version 5.5.38 was released (see [http://php.net/eol.php](http://php.net/eol.php)) and it is not maintained anymore. We have reached the resolution to stop maintaining the 5.5.x version and we encourage users of this release to move to 5.6.x because they might be exposed to unpatched security vulnerabilities.

Enjoy!
