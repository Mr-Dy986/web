Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for all platforms with the following PHP versions: 5.6.30, 7.0.16 and 7.1.2.

You can download new versions at <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html</a>.


<b>5.6.30/ v7.0.16 / 7.1.2</b>

- Updated PHP to 5.6.30 / 7.0.16 / 7.1.2
- Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.2k (for Linux and OS X)
- Updated phpMyAdmin to 4.7.0

We also modified the security configuration of XAMPP for Windows and now the server-status and server-info aliases of Apache are only accesible via localhost.

Enjoy!
