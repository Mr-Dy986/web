Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for all platforms with the latest PHP versions: 7.2.8, 7.1.20, 7.0.31 & 5.6.37.

You can download these new versions at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](/download.html).

**7.2.8 / 7.1.20 / 7.0.31 / 5.6.37**

- PHP to 7.2.8 / 7.1.20 / 7.0.31 / 5.6.37
- Apache to 2.4.34
- MariaDB to 10.1.34 (only in XAMPP 7.0.31 and 5.6.37)
- phpMyAdmin 4.8.2 (only in XAMPP 7.0.31 and 5.6.37)

**Security fix in the OS X VMs**

We also updated the base image of the OS X VMs solutions to fix the [SegmentSmack](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/962459) (CVE-2018-5390) security vulnerability. If you have a running VM, you can update the machine's kernel by running these commands

```apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
reboot
```

Enjoy!
