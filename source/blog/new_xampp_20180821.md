title: L1 Terminal Fault, privileged memory access vulnerability in Intel CPUs

Hi Apache Friends!

We just published new XAMPP OS X VMs that fix this security vulnerability. The [L1 Terminal Fault security issue](https://foreshadowattack.eu/) (also known as Foreshadow) exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors. It allows attackers to access sensitive data in a personal computer or third party clouds.

If you have a running VM, you can update the machine's kernel by running these commands

```apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
reboot
```

Enjoy!
