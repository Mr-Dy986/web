Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP for all platforms with PHP 7.3.1, 7.2.14, 7.1.26 and 5.6.40. PHP 7.0 is not supported anymore so we also dropped support for this branch.

You can download these new versions at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](/download.html).

**7.3.1 / 7.2.14 / 7.1.26 / 5.6.40**

- Updated PHP to 7.3.1 / 7.2.14 / 7.1.26 / 5.6.40

Enjoy!
