Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new versions of XAMPP installers that provide 64-bits support for Windows. Previous versions of XAMPP included 32-bits binaries that are also compatible with Windows 64-bits but there are features only available with 64-bits binaries.

You can download these new versions at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](/download.html).

These installers include the next components upgrades:

**5.6.40 / 7.1.26 / 7.2.15 / 7.3.2**

- Updated Apache to 2.4.38
- Updated MariaDB to 10.1.38
- Updated Tomcat to 7.0.92
- Updated phpMyAdmin to 4.8.5


Enjoy!
