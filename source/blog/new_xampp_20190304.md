Hi Apache Friends!

We just released new revisions of XAMPP installers for PHP versions 7.2.15 and 7.3.2 adding the missing file icudt63.dll. These installers fix an issue enabling the intl PHP extension.

You can download these new installers at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](/download.html).

Enjoy!
