And again we're on our mission to keep XAMPP up-to-date and put the first beta version of the upcoming XAMPP release in our public beta download area.

In this beta we updated both PHP versions (to 4.4.7 and 5.2.2) and phpMyAdmin (to 2.10.1). In the Windows beta we also fixed the security vulnerability published [April 28th](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/news-article,100366.html).

Get the downloads at [XAMPP BETA](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html).

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
