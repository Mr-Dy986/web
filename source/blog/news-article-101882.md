In this version we updated both PHP versions (to 4.4.7 and 5.2.2), MySQL (5.0.41) and phpMyAdmin (to 2.10.1). In the Windows beta we also fixed the security vulnerability published [April 28th](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/news-article,100366.html).

Get the downloads and more details on the specific [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
