And again we're on our mission to keep XAMPP up-to-date and put the first beta version of the upcoming XAMPP release in our public beta download area.

In this beta we updated: PHP 5 (to 5.2.3), MySQL (to 5.0.45), and phpMyAdmin (to 2.10.2). 

Get the downloads at [XAMPP BETA](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html).

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
