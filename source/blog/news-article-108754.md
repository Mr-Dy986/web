The autumn comes, and besides of chilliness and early gingerbread it brings also new versions of XAMPP for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

In all versions we updated Apache to 2.2.6, PHP to 5.2.4 and phpMyAdmin to 2.11.1. (Find more details on the specific download page.) I'm sorry to say, but under Windows we currently have problems with the new Apache and mod_perl, which doesn't work at all. We hope to find a solution soon.

Another great news: The Mac OS X version is now available as Universal Binary and runs now also on older PowerPC-based Macs.

Get the downloads and more details on the specific platforms [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
