With new versions of XAMPP for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X we wish you all a merry christmas, snow on your server farm and a warming processor in everyones heart! <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

In all three Xmas gifts we updated MySQL to 5.0.51, PHP to 5.2.5 and phpMyAdmin to 2.11.3. But we didn't update Perl because the new 5.10.0 seems to be a development version, and in XAMPP we only support "stable" versions.

Santa Downloads and more details on the specific platform's [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
