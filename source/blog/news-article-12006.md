After two big security bugs in ProFTPD and OpenSSL and one small in MySQL it's again time for a new version of XAMPP.

This version contains new or pachted versions of ProFTPD, MySQL and OpenSSL. Also new in this version: Net_SSLeay for Perl SSL support (for example for Webmin) and the OpenLDAP client library for LDAP support within PHP.
