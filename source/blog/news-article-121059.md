And again we're on our mission to keep XAMPP up-to-date and just released the first betas of the upcoming XAMPP version.

In this beta we updated: Apache (2.2.9), MySQL (5.0.51b), PHP (5.2.6), phpMyAdmin (2.11.6), mod_perl (2.0.4), OpenSSL (0.9.8h), and eAccelerator (0.9.5.3). 

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
