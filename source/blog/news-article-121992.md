It's finished. After the usual two-week beta period, we can announce the new "final" XAMPP version available for public download.

In this version we updated: Apache (2.2.9), MySQL (5.0.51b), PHP (5.2.6), phpMyAdmin (2.11.7), mod_perl (2.0.4), OpenSSL (0.9.8h), and eAccelerator (0.9.5.3). 

Get the downloads and more details on the specific platforms [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
