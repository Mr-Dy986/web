It may be tested again! Reason for the new version are two new releases of the main components of XAMPP: PHP and MySQL.

New in both XAMPP versions:  MySQL (5.0.67), PHP (4.4.9), and phpMyAdmin (2.11.8.1). .

[Go to XAMPP BETA download area](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html)

XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
