Just in time for Christmas: After the usual 2-week beta test phase, we can now announce the new "final" XAMPP version for public downloading.

In both versions we updated Apache (2.2.11), MySQL (5.1.30), PHP (5.2.8) and phpMyAdmin (3.1.1). The Linux version also contains the new MySQL storage engine PBXT (1.0.07-rc).

With this version our support of PHP 4 ends  and from this version on PHP 4 is no longer shipped with XAMPP. After PHP 4 was officially no longer supported since the end of 2007 this was just a matter of time.

On the other hand XAMPP now supports the brand-new MySQL 5.1 database generation. If you're upgrading from MySQL 5.0 please take a look at MySQL's official ["Oops, we did it again"](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/upgrading-from-5-0.html:7gb8z5mq]Upgrading from 5.0 to 5.1[/url:7gb8z5mq] and Monty's critical [url=http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2008/11/oops-we-did-it-again-mysql-51-released.html).

Updated versions for Mac OS X and Solaris will follow shortly.

Get the downloads and more details on the specific platforms [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).

Oh, and yes: Wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2009! :)
