I'm proud to announce two big news today: First, the new XAMPP with PHP 5.3.0 is finally released and allows everyone the experience of this new PHP version, and secondly, congratulations and many thanks to Carsten Wiedmann, who took over the responsibility for the Windows version. Carsten was able to simplify the Windows version by replacing the installer by a self-extracting archive without losing the ease-of-use of XAMPP.

In all versions we updated Apache (2.2.12), MySQL (5.1.37), PHP (5.3.0), phpMyAdmin (3.2.0.1), plus minor updates of some libraries and tools.
