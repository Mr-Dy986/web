Merry Christmas and a very happy new year to all of you.

We're proud to announce two new XAMPP versions for Windows and Linux today. In both versions we updated Apache to 2.2.14, MySQL to 5.1.41, PHP to 5.3.1, Perl to 5.10.1, phpMyAdmin to 3.2.4, and OpenSSL to 0.9.8l. An updated version for Mac OS X will follow soon, but currently the Apache refuses to perform his Xmas duty on a Mac.

Both downloads and more details on the specific platform's [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
