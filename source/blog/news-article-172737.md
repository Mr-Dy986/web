Here they are at last: new versions for Windows, Linux and Solaris.

The good news: The Solaris version has left beta status and is for the first time available as a full XAMPP version (currently only for SPARC, but we'll present a first x86 version at CeBIT next month). The bad news: There is no updated version for Mac OS X yet and for Windows, there will be no automated update from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4. We're very sorry about this. 

In all three versions we updated: Apache to 2.2.17, MySQL to 5.5.8, PHP to 5.3.5 and phpMyAdmin to 3.3.9, as well as minor updates in the libraries or system-specific components.

Get the downloads and further details about the new versions on the specific platforms [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
