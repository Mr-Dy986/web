After several months of hard work we are proud to announce a new release of XAMPP for Windows and Linux. 

The most important updates are: Apache 2.4.2, MySQL 5.5.25a, PHP 5.4.4, and phpMyAdmin 3.5.1. 

After this release we will focus again on the Mac OS X version of XAMPP. Sorry, for the delay, we're simply short on man power.

Get the downloads and more details on the platform specific [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
