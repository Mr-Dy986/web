Last May XAMPP became 10 years old and we think this is a good time to think again about changes and improvements to XAMPP. That's what this survey is for: to find out what are your needs and what we can do to improve XAMPP in future releases.

The survey will run for about one month (until end of September), after which we will publish the results right here.

Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey. We appreciate your feedback and we will use it to make XAMPP even more useful and enjoyable. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
