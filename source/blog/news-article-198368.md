The XAMPP 2012 survey is now over. Thank you to all who participated and helped us to get answers to our questions. Exactly 2674 individuals participated in the survey and responded with 97938 single answers in total. 

It will take some time for us to go through the results, but if you're curious about the raw results, please feel free to look at the linked PDF. Thank you all again and hopefully youâ€™ll find this data as interesting as we do.
