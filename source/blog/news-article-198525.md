What's the best thing to do on a Sunday night? Correct, get a new XAMPP version out to the Internet. Of course, what else? And here it is again, an updated XAMPP.

The most important updates are: Apache 2.4.3, MySQL 5.5.27, PHP 5.4.7, and phpMyAdmin 3.5.2.2. 

Yes, last Friday Oracle released a new MySQL 5.5.28. This version is not part of XAMPP. The time was to short to include this also in this release.

Again, we're not able to get also the Mac OS X version updated. Time is the problem. Is there anyone out there with good knowledge about GCC and AMP on Mac OS X?

Get the downloads and more details on the platform specific [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
