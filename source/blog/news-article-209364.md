We are excited to announce that we just released a new beta of XAMPP. It is a little rough around the edges, but we wanted to release it early to give you a chance to let us know what you think and help make XAMPP a better software bundle.

This is the first version we have released since we announced earlier this year that the BitNami team would be joining the XAMPP project. Thanks to their work, this version of XAMPP includes the following improvements:

- Updated main components PHP to 5.4.15, MySQL to 5.5.30, Apache to 2.4.4
- Updated Linux and Mac OS X versions of XAMPP, which had not been updated for a while. Moving forward, we aim to keep them up to date and perform releases at the same time as the Windows version. 
- New manager tools for Linux and OS X that allows starting / stopping servers using a GUI interface. 
- New GUI installers for Linux and OS X that match the Windows GUI installer.
- Support for 64bit versions of Linux and OS X.
- Expanded the number of BitNami-packaged applications compatible with XAMPP. It now includes WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, Magento, Mediawiki, Moodle and SugarCRM. You can download free, one-click installers at [https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp/](https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp/)   We plan to continue to expand the number of supported apps as time permits.
- Added support for Instaclient Oracle library for PHP (oci8.so)  

Please give it a try and let us know what you think in this thread so we can fix any issues you may find before a final release.
