Hi,

We are excited to announce that we just released a new stable version of XAMPP that includes PHP 5.4

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp.html</a><!-- m -->

This version of XAMPP includes the following improvements:

- Updated main components PHP to 5.4.16, MySQL to 5.5.32, Apache to 2.4.4, phpMyAdmin 4.0.4
- Updated Linux and Mac OS X versions of XAMPP, which had not been updated for a while. Moving forward, we aim to keep them up to date and perform releases at the same time as the Windows version.
- Updated the XAMPP Control Panel to 3.2.1 for Windows
- New manager tools for Linux and OS X that allows starting / stopping servers using a GUI interface.
- New GUI installers for Linux and OS X that match the Windows GUI installer.
- Support for 64bit versions of Linux and OS X.
- Expanded the number of BitNami-packaged applications compatible with XAMPP. It now includes WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, Magento, Mediawiki, Moodle, SugarCRM, DokuWiki, ownCloud and phpBB. You can download free, one-click installers at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp">https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp</a><!-- m --> We plan to continue to expand the number of supported apps.
- Added support for Instaclient Oracle library for PHP (oci8.so)

Thanks to all users that tried the previous Beta version and reported issues, specially to hackattack142 for the new version of the Control Panel for Windows. We continue working on a new Beta version that will ship the latest PHP 5.5.
