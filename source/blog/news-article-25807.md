Two month ago the last XAMPP for Linux version was released. We intentionally waited that long time to allow all of you a little break. But now there're so many new releases out there we need to bring out a fresh and up-to-date version of XAMPP for Linux.

This time new in XAMPP: MySQL (4.0.20), PHP (4.3.7), Perl (5.8.4), Freetype (2.1.7), mod_perl (1.99_13), OpenLDAP (client) (2.1.30),  and Dutch demo pages (many thanks to Pim Tigelaar for the translation.)
