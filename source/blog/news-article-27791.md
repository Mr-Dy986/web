Because of the importance of the bugs we think it's useful to release also up-to-date versions of XAMPP containing the new Apache release:

Please download fresh versions of [XAMPP for Linux](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html:1dpdxwne]XAMPP for Windows[/url:1dpdxwne] and/or [url=http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html).
