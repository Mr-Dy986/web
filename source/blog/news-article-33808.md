Again it's time for new XAMPP releases. New versions of Apache, PHP, and phpMyAdmin forced us to get up again and do our work. All XAMPP versions now contain Apache 2.0.52, PHP 5.0.2 and phpMyAdmin 2.6.0-pl1.

Find more details on the specific [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
