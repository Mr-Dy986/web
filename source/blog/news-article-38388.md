The MySQL developer team released some weeks ago their first production version of MySQL 4.1. The long-awaited MySQL version supporting subqueries. We added this version to XAMPP and bundled two new versions of XAMPP: XAMPP for Linux and XAMPP for Windows.

Find more details on the [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
