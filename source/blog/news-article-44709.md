We have waited a long time for this day and full of pride I may announce today the availability of our first [b:2z3zayry]XAMPP version for Mac OS X[/b:2z3zayry].  My personal thanks to Kristian W. Marcroft and Florian Pollini, which have been working on this version since the end of last year.

After a long beta test run we are also proud to announce a new versions of [b:2z3zayry]XAMPP for Linux and Windows[/b:2z3zayry] with updated versions of Apache, MySQL, Perl, phpMyAdmin, mod_perl and for the first time also with eAccelerator. 

More details on the new versions - as usual - on our [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
