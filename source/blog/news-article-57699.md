At [XAMPP BETA](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html) you can download the new beta version of the next XAMPP for Linux release. New in this version: Up-to-date versions of MySQL (4.1.14) and PHP (5.0.5), and for the first time: FPDF (1.53) and PostgeSQL support for PHP.

XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!! 

If no fatal problems occur the final release will be in the course of the next week.
