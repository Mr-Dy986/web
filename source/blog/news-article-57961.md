About a month ago the last version of XAMPP was relased and now it's again time for an updated version. MySQL and PHP released new versions of their software and as usual we need to follow in their footsteps.

New in this version of XAMPP: MySQL was upgraded to version 4.1.14, and PHP was upgraded to version 5.0.5. FPDF (version 1.53) and PostgeSQL support in PHP were newly added.

The next XAMPP for Windows version will be out at beginning October. At the moment we are so busy and not able to synchronise the release of our XAMPP versions.
