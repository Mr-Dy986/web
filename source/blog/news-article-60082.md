It may be tested again!  Although the last XAMPP versions are scarcely one month old, we started to prepare a new version of XAMPP.  Occasion for the new version are two new releases of the main components of XAMPP: Apache and MySQL.

New in both XAMPP versions:  Apache (2.0.55), MySQL (4.1.15), OpenSSL (0.9.8a) and phpMyAdmin (2.6.4-pl3).

(XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!)
