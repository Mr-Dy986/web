Today we completed the newest beta version of XAMPP for Linux and Windows.  New in this version are PHP 5.1.2 and 4.4.2, MySQL 5.0.20, eAccelerator 0.9.4, and phpMyAdmin 2.8.0.3. If beta testing is successful, the "final" version will be released in one to two weeks.

Beta releases are only for testing purposes. We would very much appreciate it if you could test this release and let us know if you run into any problems.
