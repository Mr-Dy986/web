Step by step Apache Friends becomes more international: After the translation of our website into (traditional) Chinese Apache Friends now also reaches the South American continent: Kudos to [Andr√© Domarques](http://www.dmd2.com.br/), who spend over the last weeks much of his spare time for the translation of all our website contents into Brazilian Portuguese.
