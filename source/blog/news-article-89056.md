We're setting new XAMPP versions together and would now ask you to take a look at the beta versions of the upcoming XAMPP release.

New in this version of XAMPP: MySQL (5.0.27), PHP (5.2.0), phpMyAdmin (2.9.1) and a Japanese translation. 

XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!

[b:2c8kx244]Update 18.11.:[/b:2c8kx244] Since yesterday you also find two new versions of XAMPP for Solaris as XAMPP BETA releases, one for Solaris 10 SPARC, and one for x86. These versions are the last step to finalized releases of XAMPP for Solaris. Both versions are compiled for 64-bit systems.

You find the beta version at our special [XAMPP BETA](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html) download area.
