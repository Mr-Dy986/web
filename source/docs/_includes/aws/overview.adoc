== What You Will Need

Before we begin, a few quick assumptions. This tutorial assumes that you have a XAMPP installation with a working PHP/MySQL application. It also assumes that you're familiar with the https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-command-line-client/[MariaDB command-line client] and that you have a working knowledge of transferring files between servers using FTP. 


****
If you don't have a custom PHP/MariaDB application at hand, use the example application included with this tutorial: it's a simple to-do list, created with https://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap] and PHP. You can download it link:/downloads/tasks-app-source.zip[from here].

Now, if you're new to the cloud, you might be wondering what Amazon Web Services and Bitnami are. Very briefly, https://aws.amazon.com[Amazon Web Services] is a cloud platform, which allows you to easily create Windows and Linux virtual servers online. https://bitnami.com/[Bitnami] provides pre-packaged server images for these cloud servers, so that you can become productive with them the moment they come online. In short, Amazon provides the cloud infrastructure, and Bitnami provides the server images and software. And since both Amazon and Bitnami have a free tier, you can run and manage a full-featured PHP server for free for 1 year.

For this tutorial, I'll be using https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp[LAMP packaged by Bitnami], which is Linux-based and bundles PHP, MariaDB and Apache, together with key applications and components like phpMyAdmin, SQLite, Memcache, OpenSSL, APC and cURL. LAMP packaged by Bitnami also includes a number of common PHP frameworks, including the https://framework.zend.com/[Zend Framework], https://symfony.com/[Symfony], https://codeigniter.com[CodeIgniter], https://cakephp.org/[CakePHP], https://www.smarty.net/[Smarty] and https://laravel.com/[Laravel].

To deploy your application to the Amazon cloud with LAMP packaged by Bitnami, here are the steps you'll follow:

 * Register with Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 * Register with Bitnami
 * Connect your AWS and Bitnami accounts
 * Provision an AWS cloud server with LAMP packaged by Bitnami
 * Validate the cloud server
 * Deploy and test your application on the cloud server

The next sections will walk you through these steps in detail.
