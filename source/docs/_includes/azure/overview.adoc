== What You Will Need

Before we begin, a few quick assumptions. This tutorial assumes that you have a XAMPP installation with a working PHP/MariaDB application. It also assumes that you're familiar with the https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-command-line-client/[MariaDB command-line client] and that you have a working knowledge of transferring files between servers using FTP. 


****
If you don't have a custom PHP/MySQL application at hand, use the example application included with this tutorial: it's a simple to-do list, created with https://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap] and PHP. You can download it link:/downloads/tasks-app-source.zip[from here].

Now, if you're new to the cloud, you might be wondering what Azure and Bitnami are. Very briefly, https://bitnami.com/redirect/to?from=%2Fazure&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fpricing%2Ffree-trial%2F%3FWT.mc_id%3DAEF469A45[Azure] is Microsoft's cloud platform, which allows you to easily create Windows (and Linux) virtual servers in the cloud. https://bitnami.com/[Bitnami] provides pre-packaged server images for these cloud servers, so that you can become productive with them the moment they come online. In short, Azure provides the cloud infrastructure, and Bitnami provides the server images and software.

For this tutorial, I'll be using https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp[LAMP packaged by Bitnami], which is Linux-based and bundles PHP, MariaDB and Apache, together with key applications and components like phpMyAdmin, SQLite, Memcache, OpenSSL, APC and cURL. LAMP packaged by Bitnami also includes a number of common PHP frameworks, including the https://framework.zend.com/[Zend Framework], https://symfony.com/[Symfony], https://codeigniter.com[CodeIgniter], https://cakephp.org/[CakePHP], https://www.smarty.net/[Smarty] and https://laravel.com/[Laravel].

To deploy your application to the Azure cloud with LAMP packaged by Bitnami, here are the steps you'll follow:

 * Register with Microsoft Azure
 * Register with Bitnami
 * Connect your Azure and Bitnami accounts
 * Provision an Azure cloud server with the LAMP packaged by Bitnami
 * Validate the cloud server
 * Secure the cloud server
 * Deploy and test your application on the cloud server

The next sections will walk you through these steps in detail.
